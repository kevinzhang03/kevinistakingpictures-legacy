						<h1>i take pictures</h1>
						<p>What else is there to know about me?</p>
						<hr />
						<br />

						<h1>okay, fine. a little bio</h1>
						<p>
							As you may have already guessed from the title of my site, my name is Kevin. My last name is
							Zhang. Kevin Zhang.
						</p>
						<p>
							I'm currently a second-year student at the University of Waterloo, studying electrical
							engineering. It's a tough program, but I find a lot of enjoyment from it. Digging deep into
							the technical details of how the technologies we use and take granted every day really gives
							me a sense of appreciation of the ingenuity and innovation required to make these things
							work.
						</p>
						<p>
							So aside from taking pictures, I also enjoy working on small software projects, like this
							site! Although it's literally just a website, it's been one of the proudest things I have
							made so far, since I get to incorporate my skills in development along with some of my
							hobbies -- photography! More about the site can be found below.
						</p>
						<p>
							Anyways, I'll pad this section out with more information about myself to make potential
							employers happy.
						</p>
						<p>
							I do the things I do not because it shows that I am capable of doing something, but because
							it challenges me invest myself into learning a new technology or think a different way to
							achieve what I want to achieve. Or maybe I just think that something is really hecking cool
							and I want to somehow, in one way or another, replicate that. Either way, each endeavor
							pushes me to work at the edges of what I am comfortable with and forces myself to seek
							knowledge to aid me in what I want to do.
						</p>
						<p>
							As a byproduct, I've picked up a lot of useful skills over the years like learning how to
							CAD, make games, control a robot, or efficiently design electrical circuits. I want to
							constantly get myself involved in projects that can put these things to use, and hopefully
							meet some really cool people along the way!
						</p>

						<h1>about the site</h1>
						<!-- <br />
						<h3>from start to what things are like now</h3> -->
						<p>
							This site was something that I had been wanting to do for a long time, but just lacked the
							time and knowledge to actually push out something. From creating the
							<code>index.html</code> file to me writing out this paragraph, there was about four month's
							worth of time in between. Of course, most of that work was all crammed into a weeklong
							period of pure HTML and CSS grinding into what you are reading right now.
						</p>
						<p>
							Honestly, I really wasn't sure with how I wanted to go about building the site -- whether I
							was just gonna edit a blog theme on hexo.io, use a prebuilt template and modify that, or
							even buying design off somewhere like Squarespace. Well, I did none of those and kind of
							just built this entire thing from the ground up.
						</p>
						<p>
							Of course, I relied heavily on YouTube videos and other courses to get me started and build
							<i>something.</i> I also abused the absolute shit out of Bootstrap; their entire library of
							preset and JavaScript thingies are a godsend. I think I wanna try dabble in a bit of that
							kind of JavaScript development myself, but for now this is pretty adequate.
						</p>
						<hr />
						<br />

						<h1>future plans</h1>
						<br />

						<h3>fix my shit code</h3>
						<p>
							So, I highly advise not looking through the source code of my site if you are any kind of
							web developer who knows their shit, because you will probably want to commit seppuku to
							honour your eyes from seeing my spaghetti code.
						</p>
						<p>
							Everything on here is currently a just mishmash of flex boxes that I have no idea how to
							manipulate, along with styling that sometimes use variables, sometimes hard-coded values,
							sometimes <code>px</code>, other times <code>rem</code>,,,
							<span style="text-decoration: line-through">
								Oh, and don't even get me started with the convention that everything in CSS is supposed
								to be in alphabetical order. I think that's complete bullshit. Why not just order them
								in such a way where separate blocks of CSS code that affects similar elements on the
								page are grouped together? Like <code>.easter-egg</code> and
								<code>.sneaky-link</code> are nowhere near each other on the alphabet, but their
								functionality are so closely related that it'd make sense to keep them together.
							</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							So it has come to my attention that the alphabetical ordering convention only applies to the
							properties <i>within</i> any given CSS rule. I mean, it's not like that revelation made me
							feel any better about my code; it's just as disorganized inside. So yeah, don't look at my
							source code.
						</p>
						<p>
							Anyways, just shitting on my website because I want to introduce some areas of improvement.
							Basically just maybe somehow probably implement some better practices and be more consistent
							with how I group my rules and properties. That's gonna take a lot of refactoring.
						</p>
						<br />

						<h3>manage my content better</h3>
						<p>
							Another thing is how content on my site is managed. Right now, since it's all just pure HTML
							and CSS, all the pictures and shit are all baked into the flesh of the site. Meaning, that
							if I want to changed up the pictures on my page then I have to go into the HTML and manually
							make those changes, which is tedious and no elegant. To better manage the content, I've
							considered (get this) content management systems like Contentful and Contentstack. However,
							I don't think they have a plan for individuals like me so I just plan on making one myself.
							Why not? I can just learn some PHP and MySQL and with a lot of procrastination I'll have my
							very own CMS to M my C!
						</p>
						<br />

						<h3>make an actual blog</h3>
						<p>
							You know, I have a link on my nav that says "blog" for a reason. And everything that I am
							writing here should actually just go in there instead. But then that needs its own design,
							some system to organize all of my posts which will probably require some sort of CMS which I
							do not how to work with yet...
						</p>
						<p>
							I mean maybe I can just make a static page that contains the content of each rambling I go
							on.
						</p>
						<p title="🧢">Maybe. I'll get to that soon-ish.</p>

						<hr />
						<br />

						<!-- <h1>i'm terrible at coding</h1>
						<p>
							So yeah I guess I'm using this hobby as a fallback plan. But yeah check out my other site
							for my more professional side, whenever I get around to make that. This site was already a
							pain to do. I should probably talk about photography now since this is what the entire site
							is about..
						</p>
						<p>
							Oh! And hey! If there are any employers out there that somehow stumbled upon this portion of
							the site... that was a joke!!! 哈哈哈哈哈哈
						</p>
						<hr />
						<br /> -->

						<h1>oh, i'm also a nikon shooter</h1>
						<p>
							More specifically, I use the Nikon D810. Absolute beast of a camera. Fucking love that thing
							to death. Although it's around
							<a
								href=""
								title="has it been more than eight years at this point? remind me to change it"
								class="sneaky-link"
								>eight</a
							>
							years old at this point, much of what it's capable of still holds up amazingly to this day.
							In fact, I think that the image quality you'd be able to get out of this thing even trumps
							modern professional cameras. The only thing that I don't like about it is that it lacks any
							sort of articulating screen, and that it doesn't respond to touch. Shooting low to the
							ground is a gamble most of the time since I can't even see what I'm shooting at in live view
							so I'm just spraying and praying. Speaking of live view... oh my god the autofocus in live
							view is absolute garbage. Oh? You wanna focus on that object that is only slightly out of
							focus? Great, I'll hunt the entire range of what I can focus on and maybe hit what you're
							looking for. Oh? There was a spec of dust that came into frame while I'm already focused on
							something? Of course I can start hunting for you! Oh? There is absolutely not<b
								>HING GOING ON??? YEAH, GREAT, I'LL JUST START FUCKING HUNTING BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I DO
								BEST.</b
							>
						</p>

						<br />

						<h1>i have more than one lens</h1>
						<p>
							So, you wanna know my lens collection? I guess I'll try to keep this one more to the point.
							In short, I have:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>
										The old reliable. The nifty fifty. Sharp, nimble, and delivers that scrumptious
										bokeh.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Rokinon 85mm f/1.4</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Great for portraits. I mean, you can also shoot stuff other than portraits, but
										yeah, this is what it's good for. Not as sharp, chromatic aberration is pretty
										bad, but hey it absolutely obliterates the background at f/1.4.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Tamron 28-300mm f/3.5-6.3</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Yes, the superzoom with optical stabilization. Jack of all trades. Not much else
										to really say about this lens, though. Just great if you only wanna take one
										lens with you and you have no idea what you wanna shoot.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Tamron 19-35mm f/3.5-4.5</strong>
								<ul>
									<li title="yeah, so much for tO tHE PoINt">
										So I was originally planning on buying the 14-24mm f/2.8 for $720 at a clearance
										sale, but I found this guy instead. Don't get me wrong, $720 for that lens is a
										steal, but this full frame Tamron was only $175! $175!! I don't know why this
										lens is valued so low because this thing is great. Reasonably sharp, pretty wide
										field of view, loud focus motor, and it has a 77mm filter thread! It's no f/2.8
										lens, but do you really need a fast lens if you're going wide?
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
