						<h1>i take pictures</h1>
						<p>What else is there to know about me?</p>
						<br />

						<h1>i'm terrible at coding</h1>
						<p>
							So yeah I guess I'm using this hobby as a fallback plan. But yeah check out my other site
							for my more professional side, whenever I get around to make that. This site was already a
							pain to do. I should probably talk about photography now since this is what the entire site
							is about..
						</p>
						<p>
							Oh! And hey! If there are any employers out there that somehow stumbled upon this portion of
							the site... that was a joke!!! 哈哈哈哈哈哈
						</p>
						<br />

						<h1>oh, i'm also a nikon shooter</h1>
						<p>
							More specifically, I use the Nikon D810. Absolute beast of a camera. Fucking love that thing
							to death. Although it's around
							<a
								href=""
								title="has it been more than eight years at this point? remind me to change it"
								class="sneaky-link"
								>eight</a
							>
							years old at this point, much of what it's capable of still holds up amazingly to this day.
							In fact, I think that the image quality you'd be able to get out of this thing even trumps
							modern professional cameras. The only thing that I don't like about it is that it lacks any
							sort of articulating screen, and that it doesn't repsond to touch. Shooting low to the
							ground is a gamble most of the time since I can't even see what I'm shooting at in live view
							so I'm just spraying and praying. Speaking of live view... oh my god the autofocus in live
							view is absolute garbage. Oh? You wanna focus on that object that is only slightly out of
							focus? Great, I'll hunt the entire range of what I can focus on and maybe hit what you're
							looking for. Oh? There was a spec of dust that came into frame while I'm already focused on
							something? Of course I can start hunting for you! Oh? There is absolutely not<b
								>HING GOING ON??? YEAH, GREAT, I'LL JUST START FUCKING HUNTING BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I DO
								BEST.</b

						</p>
						<br />

						<h1>i have more than one lens</h1>
						<p>
							So, you wanna know my lens collection? I guess I'll try to keep this one more to the point.
							In short, I have:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>
										The old reliable. The nifty fifty. Sharp, nimble, and delivers that scrumptious
										bokeh.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Rokinon 85mm f/1.4</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Great for portraits. I mean, you can also shoot stuff other than portaits, but
										yeah, this is what it's good for. Not as sharp, chromatic abberation is pretty
										bad, but hey it absolutely obliterates the background at f/1.4.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Tamron 28-300mm f/3.5-6.3</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Yes, the superzoom with optical stabilization. Jack of all trades. Not much else
										to really say about this lens, though. Just great if you only wanna take one
										lens with you and you have no idea what you wanna shoot.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Tamron 19-35mm f/3.5-4.5</strong>
								<ul>
									<li title="yeah, so much for tO tHE PoINt">
										So I was originally planning on buying the 14-24mm f/2.8 for $720 at a clearance
										sale, but I found this guy instead. Don't get me wrong, $720 for that lens is a
										steal, but this Tamron was only $175! $175!! Full frame as well! I don't even
										know why this lens is valued so low because this thing is great. Gets super wide
										with the ability to punch in a little, makes a super loud and adorable sound
										when it focuses since the motors turn the actual focus ring, can even fit a
										filter at this focal range! Sure, it's not as fast as the f/2.8, but do you
										really need a fast lens if you're shooting wide? Another bonus is that this
										little guy also has a manual aperture ring, which I think is pretty neat and
										would be great if I were to dive into film photography

								</ul>

						<h1>do you do film?</h1>
						<p>
							Woah, didn't know we swtiched to a Q&A format, but I'll <span title="hehe">roll</span> with
							it. So I bought a bunch of Portra 400 and a Fujica 35 ML I scored for $20 with a shutter
							that doesn't open. Got a $250 quote to have it repaired. So right now it's just a damn fine
							shelf piece. Does that count?
