						<h1>i take pictures</h1>
						<p>What else is there to know about me?</p>
						<hr />
						<br />

						<h1>okay, fine. a little bio</h1>
						<p>
							As you may have already guessed from the title of my site, my name is Kevin. My last name is
							Zhang. Kevin Zhang.
						</p>
						<p>
							I'm currently a second-year student at the University of Waterloo, studying electrical
							engineering. It's a tough program, but I find a lot of enjoyment from it. Digging deep into
							the technical details of how the technologies we use and take granted every day really gives
							me a sense of appreciation of the ingenuity and innovation required to make these things
							work.
						</p>
						<p>
							So aside from taking pictures, I also enjoy working on small software projects, like this
							site! Although it's literally just a website, it's been one of the proudest things I have
							made so far, since I get to incorporate my skills in development along with some of my
							hobbies -- photography! More about the site can be found below.
						</p>
						<p>
							Anyways, I'll pad this section out with more information about myself to make potential
							employers happy.
						</p>
						<p>
							I do the things I do not because it shows that I am capable of doing something, but because
							it challenges me invest myself into learning a new technology or think a different way to
							achieve what I want to achieve. Or maybe I just think that something is really hecking cool
							and I want to somehow, in one way or another, replicate that. Either way, each endeavor
							pushes me to work at the edges of what I am comfortable with and forces myself to seek
							knowledge to aid me in what I want to do.
						</p>
						<p>
							As a byproduct, I've picked up a lot of useful skills over the years like learning how to
							CAD, make games, control a robot, or efficiently design electrical circuits. I want to
							constantly get myself involved in projects that can put these things to use, and hopefully
							meet some really cool people along the way!

						<h1 id="about-the-site">about the site</h1>
						<!-- <br />
						<h3>from start to what things are like now</h3> -->
						<p>
							This site was something that I had been wanting to do for a long time, but just lacked the
							time and knowledge to actually push out something. From creating the
							<code>index.html</code> file to me writing out this paragraph, there was about four month's
							worth of time in between. Of course, most of that work was all crammed into a weeklong
							period of pure HTML and CSS grinding into what you are reading right now.
						</p>
						<p>
							Honestly, I really wasn't sure with how I wanted to go about building the site -- whether I
							was just gonna edit a blog theme on hexo.io, use a prebuilt template and modify that, or
							even buying design off somewhere like Squarespace. Well, I did none of those and kind of
							just built this entire thing from the ground up.
						</p>
						<p>
							Of course, I relied heavily on YouTube videos and other courses to get me started and build
							<i>something.</i> I also abused the absolute shit out of Bootstrap; their entire library of
							preset and JavaScript thingies are a godsend. I think I wanna try dabble in a bit of that
							kind of JavaScript development myself, but for now this is pretty adequate.
						</p>
						<p>
							Just a quick little shout-out: this entire site is inspired by
							<a href="https://www.instagram.com/michal.huniewicz/" target="_blank">Michal Huniewicz</a>.
							Be sure to check his work out! Recommend giving this one a look:
							<a href="https://m1key.me/photography/road_to_north_korea/" target="_blank">
								Road to North Korea</a

						<h1>future plans</h1>
						<br />

						<h3>fix my shit code</h3>
						<p>
							So, I highly advise not looking through the source code of my site if you are any kind of
							web developer who knows their stuff, because you will probably want to commit seppuku to
							honour your eyes from seeing my spaghetti code.
						</p>
						<p>
							Everything on here is currently a just mishmash of flex boxes that I have no idea how to
							manipulate, along with styling that sometimes use variables, sometimes hard-coded values,
							sometimes <code>px</code>, other times <code>rem</code>, along with randommly-ordered CSS
							properties. Just don't look at it.
						</p>
						<p>
							Anyways, just shitting on my website because I want to introduce some areas of improvement.
							Basically just maybe somehow probably implement some better practices and be more consistent
							with how I group my rules and properties. That's gonna take a lot of refactoring.
						</p>
						<br />

						<h3>manage my content better</h3>
						<p>
							Another thing is how content on my site is managed. Right now, since it's all just pure HTML
							and CSS, all the pictures other content are all baked into the flesh of the site. Meaning,
							that if I want to changed up the pictures on my page then I have to go into the HTML and
							manually make those changes, which is tedious and no elegant. To better manage the content,
							I've considered (get this) content management systems like Contentful and Contentstack.
							However, I don't think they have a plan for individuals like me so I just plan on making one
							myself. Why not? I can just learn some PHP and MySQL and with a lot of procrastination I'll
							have my very own CMS to M my C!
						</p>
						<br />

						<h3>make an actual blog</h3>
						<p>
							You know, I have a link on my nav that says "blog" for a reason. And everything that I am
							writing here should actually just go in there instead. But then that needs its own design,
							some system to organize all of my posts which will probably require some sort of CMS which I
							do not how to work with yet...
						</p>
						<p>
							I mean maybe I can just make a static page that contains the content of each rambling I go
							on.
						</p>
						<p title="🧢">Maybe. I'll get to that soon-ish.</p>
						<br />

						<h3>make this site dynamic</h3>
						<p>
							Currently, this site is just being hosted on GitHub Pages which is
							<span style="text-decoration: line-through">fine,</span> but no it's actually not fine it's
							horrible for the kind of site I want this to be. The entire point of this site is to share
							my photography and maybe my thoughts on blog posts if I ever get around to making that work
							but the current state of how everything is handled on the backend makes it very tedious and
							error-prone because theRE IS NO BACKEND TO MANAGE MY CONTENT okay I think I'm just repeating
							myself right now you know what I want sajdfkhaslhfkaj
						</p>

						<hr />
						<br />

						<!-- <h1>i'm terrible at coding</h1>
						<p>
							So yeah I guess I'm using this hobby as a fallback plan. But yeah check out my other site
							for my more professional side, whenever I get around to make that. This site was already a
							pain to do. I should probably talk about photography now since this is what the entire site
							is about..
						</p>
						<p>
							Oh! And hey! If there are any employers out there that somehow stumbled upon this portion of
							the site... that was a joke!!! 哈哈哈哈哈哈

						<h1>about my gear</h1>
						<br />

						<h1>i hecking love nikon</h1>
						<br />

						<h3>the metal (and plastic)</h3>
						<p>
							I am a loyal Nikon enjoyer and I don't have any plans to switch to a different ecosystem
							anytime soon. I used to shoot a lot of digital with my trusty D810 with plans to upgrade to
							the D850 or even Z7ii, but I've been all about analog lately.
						</p>
						<p>
							I originally wanted to purchase the Nikon F3, but then I realized I'm too much of a caveman
							and enjoy the all-mechanical aspect of the F2 better, then realized I'm too poor to afford
							either one, let alone find them readily available locally. However, I did end up stumbling
							on this gold mine of a deal on Kijiji: a Nikkormat FTn for only $50. You bet your ass I put
							that thing to good use. Probably put around 15 rolls of (EXPENSIVE ASS) film through it in
							less than a month. You should <a href="analog">check out</a> the shots :3
						</p>
						<p>
							My descent into the film photography also led me to buying purchasing two Nikon L35AFs. One
							I bought an impulsively because it was "only" $80 or so on Etsy but ended up not working.
							However, I was lucky and the seller was nice enough refund me for the camera. The other one
							I bought for a less attractive price at $225 but is mostly functional, good enough to get
							some rolls of film through. I think I have an addiction.
						</p>
						<p>
							For more of my thoughts on the film bodies I have, go to my
							<a href="analog#my-film-camera-collection">analog</a> section.
						</p>
						<br />

						<h3>the glass</h3>
						<p>I don't even know why I have this many.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>AF-S NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8G</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>
										The old reliable. The nifty fifty. Sharp, nimble, and delivers that scrumptious
										bokeh.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Rokinon 85mm f/1.4</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Great for portraits. I mean, you can also shoot stuff other than portraits, but
										yeah, this is what it's good for. Not as sharp, chromatic aberration is pretty
										bad, but hey it absolutely obliterates the background at f/1.4.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Tamron 28-300mm f/3.5-6.3</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Yes, the superzoom with optical stabilization. Jack of all trades, with
										deplorable focus breathing. Not much else to really say about this lens, though.
										Just great if you only wanna take one lens with you and you have no idea what
										you wanna shoot.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Tamron 19-35mm f/3.5-4.5</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>
										So I was originally planning on buying the 14-24mm f/2.8 for $720 at a clearance
										sale, but I found this guy instead. Don't get me wrong, $720 for that lens is a
										steal, but this full frame Tamron was only $175! $175!! I don't know why this
										lens is valued so low because this thing is great. Reasonably sharp, pretty wide
										field of view, loud focus motor, and it has a 77mm filter thread! It's no f/2.8
										lens, but do you really need a fast lens if you're going wide?
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Nikon 50mm f/1.8 Series E</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Another one so I can use it on my FTn. Buttery smooth focus ring, tactile
										aperture ring, excellent optics.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Sigma 75-200mm f/3.8 AF</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>
										This one is super weird. Can barely find any information on it online. It
										features a push-pull zoom mechanism, clicky aperture ring, and a constant f/3.8
										at all focal lengths. Maybe Sigma just wanted to one-up the the world of f/4
										zooms. On my lens specifically, one of the spring-loaded contacts is missing
										their spring, so it doesn't make full contact on AF bodies like my D810, causing
										it to spas out. I just took it out and now it's just a fully manual lens with a
										shitty focus ring. Not that I ever really intend to use this for digital
										shooting anyway.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Zoom-NIKKOR 43-86mm f/3.5</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Ah yes, the worst lens Nikon has ever made, the lens that severely tainted the
										reputation of Nikon glass for a while. So naturally I bought it. Okay, maybe I
										clickbaited you a little since I got the version with the higher serial number,
										meaning that it was a later, revised model that fixed a lot of the issues the
										initial version had. It's overall a very fun lens to use with a satisfying
										push-pull zoom, and s m o o t h focus ring. The odd focal length also adds to
										its quirkiness.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<hr />
						<br />

						<h1>that's it for now</h1>
						<p>
							There's probably a lot more to discuss, but I'll save that for now. More to come in the
							future.
