						<p>What else is there to know about me?</p>

						<br />

						<h1>i'm terrible at coding</h1>
						<p>
							So yeah I guess I'm using this hobby as a fallback plan. But yeah check out my other site
							for my more professional side, whenever I get around to make that. This site was already a
							pain to do. I should probably talk about photography now since this is what the entire site
							is about..
						</p>
						<p>
							Oh! And hey! If there are any employers out there that somehow stumbled upon this portion of
							the site... that was a joke!!! ÂìàÂìàÂìàÂìàÂìàÂìà
						</p>
						<hr />
						<br />

						<h1>oh, i'm also a nikon shooter</h1>
						<p>
							More specifically, I use the Nikon D810. Absolute beast of a camera. Fucking love that thing
							to death. Although it's around
							<a
								href=""
								title="has it been more than eight years at this point? remind me to change it"

							years old at this point, much of what it's capable of still holds up amazingly to this day.
							In fact, I think that the image quality you'd be able to get out of this thing even trumps
							modern professional cameras. The only thing that I don't like about it is that it lacks any
							sort of articulating screen, and that it doesn't repsond to touch. Shooting low to the
							ground is a gamble most of the time since I can't even see what I'm shooting at in live view
							so I'm just spraying and praying. Speaking of live view... oh my god the autofocus in live
							view is absolute garbage. Oh? You wanna focus on that object that is only slightly out of
							focus? Great, I'll hunt the entire range of what I can focus on and maybe hit what you're
							looking for. Oh? There was a spec of dust that came into frame while I'm already focused on
							something? Of course I can start hunting for you! Oh? There is absolutely not<b
								>HING GOING ON??? YEAH, GREAT, I'LL JUST START FUCKING HUNTING BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I DO

						<h1>i have more than one lens</h1>
						<p>
							So, you wanna know my lens collection? I guess I'll try to keep this one more to the point.
							In short, I have:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>
										The old reliable. The nifty fifty. Sharp, nimble, and delivers that scrumptious
										bokeh.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Rokinon 85mm f/1.4</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Great for portraits. I mean, you can also shoot stuff other than portaits, but
										yeah, this is what it's good for. Not as sharp, chromatic abberation is pretty
										bad, but hey it absolutely obliterates the background at f/1.4.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Tamron 28-300mm f/3.5-6.3</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Yes, the superzoom with optical stabilization. Jack of all trades. Not much else
										to really say about this lens, though. Just great if you only wanna take one
										lens with you and you have no idea what you wanna shoot.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Tamron 19-35mm f/3.5-4.5</strong>
								<ul>
									<li title="yeah, so much for tO tHE PoINt">
										So I was originally planning on buying the 14-24mm f/2.8 for $720 at a clearance
										sale, but I found this guy instead. Don't get me wrong, $720 for that lens is a
										steal, but this Tamron was only $175! $175!! Full frame as well! I don't even
										know why this lens is valued so low because this thing is great. Gets super wide
										with the ability to punch in a little, makes a super loud and adorable sound
										when it focuses since the motors turn the actual focus ring, can even fit a
										filter at this focal range! Sure, it's not as fast as the f/2.8, but do you
										really need a fast lens if you're shooting wide? Another bonus is that this
										little guy also has a manual aperture ring, which I think is pretty neat and
										would be great if I were to dive into film photography

						<h1>my film camera collection</h1>
						<p>
							Any hobbyist photographer has at least once considered trying out film photography, and the
							outcome is either one of of the following:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								They realize the investment into film is just not worth it when digitial photography
								exists.
							</li>
							<li>
								All of their money suddenly vanishes and then notice, gobsmacked, that they own their
								own body weight in film cameras and they completely normalized the fact that üëè every üëè
								single üëè time they press the shutter button an additional $1.50 disappears.
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>Guess which one I'm in.</p>
						<br />

						<h3>Nikkormat FTn</h3>
						<p>
							I was shopping around for an F3HP or an F2, but they were all well above what I could
							reasonably afford, espeically since I had tuition to pay. Then, I found this gem for only
							$50!!! I mean, I looked on eBay and other sites and that is about what is camera this is
							worth these days but it's still an amazing little guy. Sure, it doesn't have any sort of
							shoe mount, only goes up to 1/1000s, and has a light meter that only works with 1.35V
							batteries that you can no longer find today, but shooting with this camera is still a
							pleasure.
						</p>
						<p>
							Now, I absolutely do not know a lot of what I'm talking about since I am very new to analog
							photography but as long as I am having a good time with it, that's all the matters right?

						<p>
							One thing I love about this camera is that it's entirely mechanical. Unlike the F3,
							everything will still fucntion (imaging wise) with or without a battery. It makes me
							apprecitae that what I'm shooting with is all powered by its inner workings of
							whateverthefuck designed by engineering geniuses, rather than just a mundane electric
							circuit.
						</p>
						<p>
							Of course, like I said, the only thing that does need the battery is the light meter. And
							since you have to use 1.35V batteries which are not manufactured anymore it'll be pretty
							rare to have the opportunity to consistently shoot with a working meter.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, any self-respecting film photographer will probably use their own intuition to
							accurately meter the exposure themselves, rather than rely on a tool. I guess that's what
							I'm currently doing when I do go out and shoot with this camera, but since I have never had
							the need to think about what settings to use when shooting (thanks D810 aperture priority)
							my judgement is still very rudimentary. I've just been using the sunny 16 rule, and making
							the recommended adjustments under different lighting conditions to guess my exposure.
						</p>
						<p>
							Also, to set shutter speed you have to turn the ring around the mount. I'll admit, it's a
							pretty neat spot but I think I would prefer to just have the controls on the top like most
							other caneras. Also, with how much hardware you're moving it can get a litlte tough to push
							adjust it.
						</p>
						<p>
							Maybe I should write a little article about my experience with shooting film as a complete
							noob. You know, like a blog ‡≤†_‡≤†
						</p>

						<h3>Nikon L35AF</h3>
						<p>Did I mention I was a Nikon shooter?</p>

						<p>
							Supposedly a legendary camera, they usually go for $300-400 on eBay. However, I got lucky
							with mine and found it listed for only $80 on Etsy. Lucky me.
							<span style="text-decoration: line-through"
								>Well, I don't even know if it works since the seller wasn't very knowledgable in
								cameras and couldn't test it thoroughly. I think I'll probably still keep it even if it
								doesn't work since it's a sick camera and I could maybe get it repaired.</span
							>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="text-decoration: line-through">
								It's still being transported so I don't have it yet to take picture of. I'll write up my
								thoughts about it after it arrives and have had a chance to shoot with it.
							</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							So it arrived and guess what! Basically the thing is broken. The batteries do power the
							thing but it's always doing things it's not supposed to be doing; it's very erratic. Took it
							to Downtown Camera and the guy told me that since it's a point-and-shoot cammera, fixing
							this thing will be next to impossible, let alone at a decent price. The shipping itself to
							the repair center itself is $80! That's what I fucking paid for this camera!!!

							Calm down, yes, this isn't a Nikon camera. However, this was the first film camera I decided
							to pick up since it was only $20 on Kijiji. Now I know why you don't just buy film cameras
							for $20 and expect to salvage it, let it have it function. The aperture blades are stuck,
							and the shutter won't even open if I try to take a shot. Took it to Downtown Camera to get
							it looked at and get this- a $250 quote to get this thing <i>maybe</i> working sicne it's
							such an old niche camera. But hey, it makes for a very stylish paperweight.

							This thing is built like a tank, though. the build quality is astonishing and feels way
							heavier than it looks. It's almost as heavy as my D810 without a lens. They really didn't
							mess around with film camera construction back in the day. So yeah, now it's retired to
							being a paperweight.
