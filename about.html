						<h1>i take pictures</h1>
						<p>What else is there to know about me?</p>
						<hr />
						<br />

						<h1>okay, fine. a little bio</h1>
						<p>
							As you may have already guessed from the title of my site, my name is Kevin. My last name is
							Zhang. Kevin Zhang.
						</p>
						<p>
							I'm currently a second-year student at the University of Waterloo, studying electrical
							engineering. It's a tough program, but I find a lot of enjoyment from it. Digging deep into
							the technical details of how the technologies we use and take granted every day really gives
							me a sense of appreciation of the ingenuity and innovation required to make these things
							work.
						</p>
						<p>
							So aside from taking pictures, I also enjoy working on small software projects, like this
							site! Although it's literally just a website, it's been one of the proudest things I have
							made so far, since I get to incorporate my skills in development along with some of my
							hobbies -- photography! More about the site can be found below.
						</p>
						<p>
							Anyways, I'll pad this section out with more information about myself to make potential
							employers happy.
						</p>
						<p>
							I do the things I do not because it shows that I am capable of doing something, but because
							it challenges me invest myself into learning a new technology or think a different way to
							achieve what I want to achieve. Or maybe I just think that something is really hecking cool
							and I want to somehow, in one way or another, replicate that. Either way, each endeavor
							pushes me to work at the edges of what I am comfortable with and forces myself to seek
							knowledge to aid me in what I want to do.
						</p>
						<p>
							As a byproduct, I've picked up a lot of useful skills over the years like learning how to
							CAD, make games, control a robot, or efficiently design electrical circuits. I want to
							constantly get myself involved in projects that can put these things to use, and hopefully
							meet some really cool people along the way!
						</p>

						<br />

						<h1>about the site</h1>
						<!-- <br />
						<h3>from start to what things are like now</h3> -->
						<p>
							This site was something that I had been wanting to do for a long time, but just lacked the
							time and knowledge to actually push out something. From creating the
							<code>index.html</code> file to me writing out this paragraph, there was about four month's
							worth of time in between. Of course, most of that work was all crammed into a weeklong
							period of pure HTML and CSS grinding into what you are reading right now.
						</p>
						<p>
							Honestly, I really wasn't sure with how I wanted to go about building the site -- whether I
							was just gonna edit a blog theme on hexo.io, use a prebuilt template and modify that, or
							even buying design off somewhere like Squarespace. Well, I did none of those and kind of
							just built this entire thing from the ground up.
						</p>
						<p>
							Of course, I relied heavily on YouTube videos and other courses to get me started and build
							<i>something.</i> I also abused the absolute shit out of Bootstrap; their entire library of
							preset and JavaScript thingies are a godsend. I think I wanna try dabble in a bit of that
							kind of JavaScript development myself, but for now this is pretty adequate.
						</p>
						<hr />
						<br />

						<h1>future plans</h1>
						<br />

						<h3>fix my shit code</h3>
						<p>
							So, I highly advise not looking through the source code of my site if you are any kind of
							web developer who knows their shit, because you will probably want to commit seppuku to
							honour your eyes from seeing my spaghetti code.
						</p>
						<p>
							Everything on here is currently a just mishmash of flex boxes that I have no idea how to
							manipulate, along with styling that sometimes use variables, sometimes hard-coded values,
							sometimes <code>px</code>, other times <code>rem</code>,,,
							<span style="text-decoration: line-through">
								Oh, and don't even get me started with the convention that everything in CSS is supposed
								to be in alphabetical order. I think that's complete bullshit. Why not just order them
								in such a way where separate blocks of CSS code that affects similar elements on the
								page are grouped together? Like <code>.easter-egg</code> and
								<code>.sneaky-link</code> are nowhere near each other on the alphabet, but their
								functionality are so closely related that it'd make sense to keep them together.
							</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							So it has come to my attention that the alphabetical ordering convention only applies to the
							properties <i>within</i> any given CSS rule. I mean, it's not like that revelation made me
							feel any better about my code; it's just as disorganized inside. So yeah, don't look at my
							source code.
						</p>
						<p>
							Anyways, just shitting on my website because I want to introduce some areas of improvement.
							Basically just maybe somehow probably implement some better practices and be more consistent
							with how I group my rules and properties. That's gonna take a lot of refactoring.
						</p>
						<br />

						<h3>manage my content better</h3>
						<p>
							Another thing is how content on my site is managed. Right now, since it's all just pure HTML
							and CSS, all the pictures and shit are all baked into the flesh of the site. Meaning, that
							if I want to changed up the pictures on my page then I have to go into the HTML and manually
							make those changes, which is tedious and no elegant. To better manage the content, I've
							considered (get this) content management systems like Contentful and Contentstack. However,
							I don't think they have a plan for individuals like me so I just plan on making one myself.
							Why not? I can just learn some PHP and MySQL and with a lot of procrastination I'll have my
							very own CMS to M my C!
						</p>
						<br />

						<h3>make an actual blog</h3>
						<p>
							You know, I have a link on my nav that says "blog" for a reason. And everything that I am
							writing here should actually just go in there instead. But then that needs its own design,
							some system to organize all of my posts which will probably require some sort of CMS which I
							do not how to work with yet...
						</p>
						<p>
							I mean maybe I can just make a static page that contains the content of each rambling I go
							on.
						</p>
						<p title="🧢">Maybe. I'll get to that soon-ish.</p>

						<hr />
						<br />

						<!-- <h1>i'm terrible at coding</h1>
						<p>
							So yeah I guess I'm using this hobby as a fallback plan. But yeah check out my other site
							for my more professional side, whenever I get around to make that. This site was already a
							pain to do. I should probably talk about photography now since this is what the entire site
							is about..
						</p>
						<p>
							Oh! And hey! If there are any employers out there that somehow stumbled upon this portion of
							the site... that was a joke!!! 哈哈哈哈哈哈
						</p>
						<hr />
						<br /> -->

						<h1>oh, i'm also a nikon shooter</h1>
						<p>
							More specifically, I use the Nikon D810. Absolute beast of a camera. Fucking love that thing
							to death. Although it's around
							<a
								href=""
								title="has it been more than eight years at this point? remind me to change it"
								class="sneaky-link"
								>eight</a
							>
							years old at this point, much of what it's capable of still holds up amazingly to this day.
							In fact, I think that the image quality you'd be able to get out of this thing even trumps
							modern professional cameras. The only thing that I don't like about it is that it lacks any
							sort of articulating screen, and that it doesn't respond to touch. Shooting low to the
							ground is a gamble most of the time since I can't even see what I'm shooting at in live view
							so I'm just spraying and praying. Speaking of live view... oh my god the autofocus in live
							view is absolute garbage. Oh? You wanna focus on that object that is only slightly out of
							focus? Great, I'll hunt the entire range of what I can focus on and maybe hit what you're
							looking for. Oh? There was a spec of dust that came into frame while I'm already focused on
							something? Of course I can start hunting for you! Oh? There is absolutely not<b
								>HING GOING ON??? YEAH, GREAT, I'LL JUST START FUCKING HUNTING BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I DO
								BEST.</b
							>
						</p>
						<hr />
						<br />

						<h1>i have more than one lens</h1>
						<p>
							So, you wanna know my lens collection? I guess I'll try to keep this one more to the point.
							In short, I have:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>
										The old reliable. The nifty fifty. Sharp, nimble, and delivers that scrumptious
										bokeh.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Rokinon 85mm f/1.4</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Great for portraits. I mean, you can also shoot stuff other than portraits, but
										yeah, this is what it's good for. Not as sharp, chromatic aberration is pretty
										bad, but hey it absolutely obliterates the background at f/1.4.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Tamron 28-300mm f/3.5-6.3</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Yes, the superzoom with optical stabilization. Jack of all trades. Not much else
										to really say about this lens, though. Just great if you only wanna take one
										lens with you and you have no idea what you wanna shoot.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Tamron 19-35mm f/3.5-4.5</strong>
								<ul>
									<li title="yeah, so much for tO tHE PoINt">
										So I was originally planning on buying the 14-24mm f/2.8 for $720 at a clearance
										sale, but I found this guy instead. Don't get me wrong, $720 for that lens is a
										steal, but this full frame Tamron was only $175! $175!! I don't know why this
										lens is valued so low because this thing is great. Reasonably sharp, pretty wide
										field of view, loud focus motor, and it has a 77mm filter thread! It's no f/2.8
										lens, but do you really need a fast lens if you're going wide?
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<hr />
						<br />

						<h1>my film camera collection</h1>
						<p>
							Any hobbyist photographer has at least once considered trying out film photography, and the
							outcome is either one of of the following:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								They realize the investment into film is just not worth it when digital photography and
								a little work in Lightroom can achieve the sane thing for less.
							</li>
							<li>
								All of their money suddenly vanishes and then notice, gobsmacked, that they own their
								own body weight in film cameras and they completely normalized the fact that 👏 every 👏
								single 👏 time they press the shutter button an additional $1.50 disappears.
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>Guess which one I'm in.</p>
						<br />

						<h3>Nikkormat FTn</h3>
						<p>
							I was shopping around for an F3HP or an F2, but they were all well above what I could
							reasonably afford, especially since I had tuition to pay. Then, I found this gem for only
							$50!!! I mean, I looked on eBay and other sites and that is about what is camera this is
							worth these days but it's still an amazing little guy. Sure, it doesn't have any sort of
							shoe mount, only goes up to 1/1000s, and has a light meter that only works with 1.35V
							batteries that you can no longer find today, but shooting with this camera is still a
							pleasure.
						</p>
						<p>
							Now, I absolutely do not know a lot of what I'm talking about since I am very new to analog
							photography but as long as I am having a good time with it, that's all the matters right?
						</p>

						<p>
							One thing I love about this camera is that it's entirely mechanical. Unlike the F3,
							everything will still function (imaging wise) with or without a battery. It makes me
							appreciate that what I'm shooting with is all powered by its inner workings of
							whateverthefuck designed by engineering geniuses, rather than just a mundane electric
							circuit.
						</p>
						<p>
							Of course, like I said, the only thing that does need the battery is the light meter. And
							since you have to use 1.35V batteries which are not manufactured anymore it'll be pretty
							rare to have the opportunity to consistently shoot with a working meter.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, any self-respecting film photographer will probably use their own intuition to
							accurately meter the exposure themselves, rather than rely on a tool. I guess that's what
							I'm currently doing when I do go out and shoot with this camera, but since I have never had
							the need to think about what settings to use when shooting (thanks D810 aperture priority)
							my judgement is still very rudimentary. I've just been using the sunny 16 rule, and making
							the recommended adjustments under different lighting conditions to guess my exposure.
						</p>
						<p>
							Also, to set shutter speed you have to turn the ring around the mount. I'll admit, it's a
							pretty neat spot but I think I would prefer to just have the controls on the top like most
							other cameras. Also, with how much hardware you're moving it can get a little tough to push
							adjust it.
						</p>
						<p>
							Maybe I should write a little article about my experience with shooting film as a complete
							noob. You know, like a blog ಠ_ಠ
						</p>
						<br />

						<h3>Nikon L35AF</h3>
						<p>Did I mention I was a Nikon shooter?</p>

						<p>
							Supposedly a legendary camera, they usually go for $300-400 on eBay. However, I got lucky
							with mine and found it listed for only $80 on Etsy. Lucky me.
							<span style="text-decoration: line-through"
								>Well, I don't even know if it works since the seller wasn't very knowledgeable in
								cameras and couldn't test it thoroughly. I think I'll probably still keep it even if it
								doesn't work since it's a sick camera and I could maybe get it repaired.</span
							>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="text-decoration: line-through">
								It's still being transported so I don't have it yet to take picture of. I'll write up my
								thoughts about it after it arrives and have had a chance to shoot with it.
							</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							So it arrived and guess what! Basically the thing is broken. The batteries do power the
							thing but it's always doing things it's not supposed to be doing; it's very erratic. Took it
							to Downtown Camera and the guy told me that since it's a point-and-shoot camera, fixing this
							thing will be next to impossible, let alone at a decent price. The shipping itself to the
							repair center itself is $80! That's what I fucking paid for this camera!!!

							So yeah, in short, it's not in a functioning state. The Etsy seller didn't rip me off or

							Calm down, yes, this isn't a Nikon camera. However, this was the first film camera I decided
							to pick up since it was only $20 on Kijiji. Now I know why you don't just buy film cameras
							for $20 and expect to salvage it, let it have it function. The aperture blades are stuck,
							and the shutter won't even open if I try to take a shot. Took it to Downtown Camera to get
							it looked at and get this- a $250 quote to get this thing <i>maybe</i> working since it's
							such an old niche camera. But hey, it makes for a very stylish paperweight.
