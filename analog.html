						<h1>analog</h1>
						<p>Sounds cooler than saying "film" in my opinion.</p>
						<p>
							The thing about analog photography I really enjoy is that you can find a scene, you can see
							what you wanna shoot, and you can compose your shot with your camera and just fire your
							shutter. However, in that moment, that's just it. There's no going back to shoot a better
							shot because this is the only chance ever that you will get a scene like this. More
							importantly, you don't even know what your picture even looks like until you get your film
							developed and scanned. So what you get is what you get.
						</p>
						<hr />
						<br />

						<h1>some of my favourite scans</h1>
						<p>
							These are just some the film scans that I personally thought were really good. Check out the
							rest of my scans here! Or, well, whenever I get around to making the page to view all of my
							scans. If you're savvy, you can just check them out on my
							<a

						<h1>my film camera collection</h1>
						<p>
							Any hobbyist photographer has at least once considered trying out film photography, and the
							outcome is either one of of the following:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								They realize the investment into film is just not worth it when digital photography and
								a little work in Lightroom can achieve the sane thing for less.
							</li>
							<li>
								All of their money suddenly vanishes and then notice, gobsmacked, that they own their
								own body weight in film cameras and they completely normalized the fact that 👏 every 👏
								single 👏 time they press the shutter button an additional $1.50 disappears.
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>Guess which one I'm in.</p>
						<br />

						<h3>Nikkormat FTn</h3>
						<p>
							I was shopping around for an F3HP or an F2, but they were all well above what I could
							reasonably afford, especially since I had tuition to pay. Then, I found this gem for only
							$50!!! I mean, I looked on eBay and other sites and that is about what is camera this is
							worth these days but it's still an amazing little guy. Sure, it doesn't have any sort of
							shoe mount, only goes up to 1/1000s, and has a light meter that only works with 1.35V
							batteries that you can no longer find today, but shooting with this camera is still a
							pleasure.
						</p>
						<p>
							Now, I absolutely do not know a lot of what I'm talking about since I am very new to analog
							photography but as long as I am having a good time with it, that's all the matters right?
						</p>

						<p>
							One thing I love about this camera is that it's entirely mechanical. Unlike the F3,
							everything will still function (imaging wise) with or without a battery. It makes me
							appreciate that what I'm shooting with is all powered by its inner workings of
							whateverthefuck designed by engineering geniuses, rather than just a mundane electric
							circuit.
						</p>
						<p>
							Of course, like I said, the only thing that does need the battery is the light meter. And
							since you have to use 1.35V batteries which are not manufactured anymore it'll be pretty
							rare to have the opportunity to consistently shoot with a working meter.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, any self-respecting film photographer will probably use their own intuition to
							accurately meter the exposure themselves, rather than rely on a tool. I guess that's what
							I'm currently doing when I do go out and shoot with this camera, but since I have never had
							the need to think about what settings to use when shooting (thanks D810 aperture priority)
							my judgement is still very rudimentary. I've just been using the sunny 16 rule, and making
							the recommended adjustments under different lighting conditions to guess my exposure.
						</p>
						<p>
							Also, to set shutter speed you have to turn the ring around the mount. I'll admit, it's a
							pretty neat spot but I think I would prefer to just have the controls on the top like most
							other cameras. Also, with how much hardware you're moving it can get a little tough to push
							adjust it.
						</p>
						<p>
							Maybe I should write a little article about my experience with shooting film as a complete
							noob. You know, like a blog ಠ_ಠ
						</p>

						<h3>Nikon L35AF</h3>
						<p>Did I mention I was a Nikon shooter?</p>

						<p>
							Supposedly a legendary camera, they usually go for $300-400 on eBay. However, I got lucky
							with mine and found it listed for only $80 on Etsy. Lucky me.
							<span style="text-decoration: line-through"
								>Well, I don't even know if it works since the seller wasn't very knowledgeable in
								cameras and couldn't test it thoroughly. I think I'll probably still keep it even if it
								doesn't work since it's a sick camera and I could maybe get it repaired.</span
							>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="text-decoration: line-through">
								It's still being transported so I don't have it yet to take picture of. I'll write up my
								thoughts about it after it arrives and have had a chance to shoot with it.
							</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							So it arrived and guess what! Basically the thing is broken. The batteries do power the
							thing but it's always doing things it's not supposed to be doing; it's very erratic. Took it
							to Downtown Camera and the guy told me that since it's a point-and-shoot camera, fixing this
							thing will be next to impossible, let alone at a decent price. The shipping itself to the
							repair center itself is $80! That's what I fucking paid for this camera!!!

							So yeah, in short, it's not in a functioning state. The Etsy seller didn't rip me off or
							anything, she's not knowledgeable in cameras and told me I'm able to return it if it doesn't
							work. Currently debating returning it or keeping it and trying to fix it myself. Could be a
							fun little side side project. More content for this mess of a site.

						<h3>Fujica 35 ML</h3>

							Calm down, yes, this isn't a Nikon camera. However, this was the first film camera I decided
							to pick up since it was only $20 on Kijiji. Now I know why you don't just buy film cameras
							for $20 and expect to salvage it, let it have it function. The aperture blades are stuck,
							and the shutter won't even open if I try to take a shot. Took it to Downtown Camera to get
							it looked at and get this- a $250 quote to get this thing <i>maybe</i> working since it's
							such an old niche camera. But hey, it makes for a very stylish paperweight.
