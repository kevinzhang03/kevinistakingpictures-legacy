						This entire site is a WIP, but hey I managed to get something out at least. For now, only the
						home and about page will have content on it, the other pages are just there for filler. For now,
						just enjoy some of work that I'm proud of! The images here might appear low-res, and I wanna add
						a way for you to download the full file for yourself to view. It's in the works.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you have any feedback regarding the layout of the site, mobile-desktop responsiveness, or how
						this entire site is just absolute dogshit, shoot me a message and let me know! Made a nifty
						little email button :)
					</p>
					<p>
						This entire site is inspired by
						<a href="https://www.instagram.com/michal.huniewicz/" target="_blank">Michal Huniewicz</a>. Be
						sure to check his work out! Recommend giving this one a look:

							To me, this picture makes me feel like I'm in a place that is dark, messy, and unpleasant.
							However, as I take in the details of the diverse and vibrant storefronts off in the
							background, the more the scene transforms into an organized chaos of diverse culture and
							rich history. There is just so much explore and discover in this area of town.

							Icha Tea. It's a neat little bubble tea shop on Spadina. Their prices are a bit higher but
							the interior vibe perfectly reflects the premium. They even have a little space for you to
							drink your tea and order desserts in way in the back. Thankfully, I don't think all the
							money has been put into the design of the shop; I had their chrysanthemum pu er tea, and I
							was pleasantly reminded of the familiar taste of chrysanthemum with just the right
							compliment of bitterness. Their signature strawberry matcha is also popular among guests,
							but I never got to try it yet.
